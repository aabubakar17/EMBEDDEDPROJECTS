# Abubakar's Lab 2


The code toggles the blue and red led for 3 sec and turn off both led on every random press(for the duration of the press). There are two tasks:
  1. The 'randomPress' tasks simulates a button press at random intervals.
  2. toggleBlueandRed: this toggles the blue and Red LED and turns off both LED on every press
  
The behaviour is described by the following state-transition diagram:
